# Market Basket Analysis using Python

## Overview

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to uncover associations between items purchased together in transactions. In this project, we perform Market Basket Analysis on a grocery store dataset to identify frequent itemsets and association rules that can provide valuable insights for retail businesses.

## Dataset

The dataset contains transaction data from a grocery store, where each row represents a transaction and the items purchased during that transaction. There are no headers in the dataset, and each line consists of a list of items bought.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset, preprocess the data, and convert it into a suitable format for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of items, transaction frequency, and other relevant insights.
3. Market Basket Analysis: Perform Market Basket Analysis to identify frequent itemsets and association rules using techniques such as the Apriori algorithm and association rule mining.
4. Visualization: Visualize the association rules using scatterplots, parallel coordinates, or other suitable visualization techniques to gain insights into item associations and relationships.
5. Interpretation and Insights: Interpret the results of the analysis, identify significant patterns, and derive actionable insights for retail businesses.
6. Documentation: Document the analysis process, findings, and insights in a clear and concise manner for stakeholders and future reference.
